                <p><h3>Toledo, OH</h3><img src="http://matrixti.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Toledo-62548928-cropped-3.jpg"/></p>
                    <br>Interestingly enough this is actually where my entire family is from. When i linked up with this general contractor who is based in this town in Ohio i was excited to see some of my family and even be close to my favorite uncle.</p>
                <p><h3>Wintersville, OH</h3><br>Kicking things off in a city close to where i started, Wintersville OH was the first Walmart Distribution center i was welcomed on to install a brand new <strong>hydrogen fueling station.</strong>You will see later the few different types of fuel stations i was a part of in my travels but hydrogen and walmart will be mentioned quite a bit.</p>
                <p><h3>York, PA</h3>If youve never been to Pennsylvania in the Fall, i really suggest you book that trip. I had never been before and when i landed there right in october i swore i had never seen so many colors. York, Pennsylvania is where i went and did my first CNG time-fill station. We worked long hours but when i was off at night i would drive the work truck around and try to get lost in the winding roads and find as many horse and buggy drivers as i could. I have yet to return to PA since finishing up my work there but i am going to go back one Fall.</p>
                <p><h3>Harrisburg, PA</h3>During the few months i spent in Pennsylvania we actually had two different projects going about an hour away from each other. On the one, we had a time-fill and in Harrisburg we were building a regular CNG fuel station for government and local concrete vehicles. This was cool to me because it broadened what i was able to see in the state and left me with a bigger desire to one day go back and visit what i had built.</p>
                <p><h3>Elizabethtown, KY</h3>In Kentucky is where i finally met up with a few more of the employees that the company i worked for had traveling to different places. We met here because on the nearby military base, Fort Knox, they wanted an all-out fueling station for all of their vehicles such as regular humvees, tanks, other response vehicles, and even their planes! I was in KY for a good month and i got to meet some cool people. I even spent a few weekends down in Louisville, which was cool becuase i am a Cardinals fan.</p>
                <p><h3>Plainview, TX</h3>As far as interesting places go, Plainview Texas is not one of them. Its exactly what it sounds like, a flat, plain view. Here i was back on Walmart Distribution Centers and installing the stainless steel tubing on the roof of the building for a hydrogen pad that would eventually get built. From atop of this roof, of the only business in town i could pretty well see the entire town. The one bar, the one hotel and the three gas stations, of which only one would have a walk-in beer cave, which turns out, is super important when youre stranded in the middle of nowhere. I met one cool person there but i hope he visits me because Plainview Texas is not on my list of places to return to. </p>
                <p><h3>Chicago, IL</h3><img src="https://eatanmol.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/chicago-il-cloud-gate-at-dusk.jpg"/></p>
                    <br>We are now at my favorite place that i was able to see along my journey, <em>Chicago!</em> This was a change up in what i was now used to seeing; fuel. We linked up with a Cummins truck stop and were there to build a new CNG/LNG bay. These are special because it had to be completely sealed off to the rest of the bays in case of a fire or a methane leak. In addition to the wall i built, i also installed a few methane and carbon dioxide gas detectors. <br>Chicago in the winter is really cold, but spending a weekend off in the Hardrock hotel just above the west loop was freaking amazing. The culture in chicago is very diverse and i did not come into contact with a single unpleasant person for the two months that i was there. If you have never been to this <strong>windy city</strong> i highly reccomend you go when you can. Go to a Blackhawks game or spend time in the museum you will not be disappointed.</p>
                <p><h3>Jeffersonville, IN</h3>Jeffersonville got to see our first CNG vapor curtain. This curtain, able to keep out methane gas and heat from the trucks being worked on in that bay had to be completely sealed along the top and sides with a swinging door in the middle. This is not such a simple task but the crew and i were able to handle it in just a few days, working overtime and skating right out of Indiana just like we came. That being said, i did not experience much of Jeffersonville aside from the crappy hotel and the fact that they had strict beer laws and finding beer just wasnt happening outside of a distributor. Looking back, this is probably why the boss pushed so hard to get in and get out.</p>
                <p><h3>Tampa, FL</h3>All finished up with these other projects and returning back to Ohio where we were based out of i made the hard decision to leave the traveling gig and find a temporarily permanent place in Tampa near my folks and other friends. Once i got to Tampa i immediately found this Launchcode Academy at Career Source and jumped at the chance to learn a new skill that wouldnt break my back up until i was 60. I very much enjoy being here in Tampa and i cannot wait to learn everything that this program is willing to teach as well as set a career path in this field of software/computer development. This will mark the end of my first webpage and i am thankful for the teachers i have who will be showing me some more skills to show off in the future.</p>
